# Supermarket-Delivery

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/c7f370b5f11b4b0dba1817c1908cb5fe)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/vCamilx/Supermarket-Delivery?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=vCamilx/Supermarket-Delivery&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

<h4>What does this project consist of</h4>

In this project I have tried to implement the design pattern, functional programming, and some other similar functions
in addition to some of my general knowledge.

<h4>Example of what I mean by functional programming</h4>

```java 
int setPrice = prices.stream().mapToInt(integer -> integer).sum();
```

<h4>How is it used</h4>

Well, as it is a simple project there is no way to save the data permanently, but still, it will be temporarily saved in
a list while the program is running, so you can go to the menu and your product list will still be valid.

Suppose you are the salesperson of a supermarket, and you want to get a receipt with all the purchases, and their
corresponding information such as: time, transaction id, the salesperson, which product it was, how many products were
purchased and/or the total value of your purchases.

In addition, we have tried to use the functions previously learned in the old devcamp classes such as code optimization
or object creation.
